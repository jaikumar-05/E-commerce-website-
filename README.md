HTML Structure: Begin by structuring your e-commerce website using HTML. This includes creating the necessary pages such as a homepage, product pages, cart page, checkout page, etc. Use semantic HTML elements to define the structure of your content.<br>
CSS Styling with Bootstrap: Utilize Bootstrap, a front-end framework, to streamline the styling process and ensure responsiveness across different devices. Bootstrap provides ready-made components and utilities for building user interfaces efficiently. Customize Bootstrap styles to match your brand's identity.<br>
Product Listing: Create a product listing page where users can browse through different products. Display product images, titles, prices, and brief descriptions in a visually appealing grid or list layout. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for better navigation if you have a large number of products.<br>
Product Details: Design individual product pages that provide detailed information about each product. Include product images, descriptions, specifications, pricing, and the option to add the product to the cart. Implement a zoom feature for product images and use tabs or accordion elements for organizing additional information.<br>
Shopping Cart: Develop a shopping cart feature that allows users to add products, update quantities, remove items, and proceed to checkout. Display a summary of the cart contents, including the total price and any applicable taxes or shipping fees. Use JavaScript to handle cart functionality such as adding/removing items and calculating totals.
